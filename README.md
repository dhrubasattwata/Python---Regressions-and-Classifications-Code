# Python---Regressions-and-Classifications-Code
Sample codes for Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KMeans Classifier and Decision Tree.

1. Code setting up a univariate and multivariate linear regression models, with detailed analysis on variable selection and performance measures.
2. Code setting up a logistic regression model with variable selection and performance metrics such as accuaracy, confusion matrix and ROC.
3. Code setting up a basic K-means classifier and using Elbow Method to deduce optimal number of clusters.
4. Code setting up a decision tree classifier and performance metric using a modified confusion matrix.
